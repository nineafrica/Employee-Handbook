# Performance Review

- Performance Review happens four times/year, every quarter.
- We pay everyone equally. For ex : If you're a junior developer, all the other junior developers are paid the same. You can see [Salary Slabs here](/people-operations/salary/README.md).
- Your manager is responsible for reviewing your performance every year.
- If you qualify for the next role. We will have you promoted.
